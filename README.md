# - PLANETOID - HTML5 CANVAS

## Description

Planetoid is a Space-themed multidirectional shooter arcade game inspired by the classic 'Asteroids' designed by Lyle Rains and Ed Logg released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc.[4] <br/>
The player controls a spaceship, both with keyboard keys and mouse, in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by different types of flying objects. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids while not colliding with them. <br/>
